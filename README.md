This plugin was written for SeniorTeam

## Breif

The plugin you will be making is a tempban plugin with a view command. 

You will need to make 2 commands.

/tempban <user> <time> <reason> - This will ban the user for a specific time 
/tempban view <user> - This will show how long  the user is banned for.

You will need to save the time of the users who are tempbanned so they can't rejoin on restart.
